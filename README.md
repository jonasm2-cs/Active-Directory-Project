# Active Directory Project

## Objective
This Active Directory project is aimed to establish a controlled environment for simulating and detecting cyber attacks. The primary focus is to setup an Acitve Directory environment, setup Splunk to detect unauthorized logins, and setup automated responses to the alert using Shuffle as our main Securtiy Orchestration, Automation, Response (SOAR) Tool. This hands-on experience was designed to deepen understanding of network security, attack patterns, and defensive strategies.
